## Conditions

The **{{License_Name}}** license grants an unlimited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to print, use, modify, copy and adapt *3D prints* of a *3D model* from its *3D digital files* that are downloadable from the site. It also grants permission to distribute the *3D prints* of said digital files and those *adapted* from them, including for commercial purposes for as long as this license is applied to the *licensed 3D model*.

When you exercise the rights granted by the license (defined below), you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this **{{License_Name}}** license. To the extent that this license may be construed as a contract, you are granted the rights granted by the license in consideration of your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the *designer(s)* grants you those rights in consideration of the benefits of making available the *3D digital files* of the *licensed 3D model* under these terms and conditions.

#### Article 1 - Definitions

- A *3D model* is the result of 3D modeling, a process to develop a three-dimensional representation of animated or living objects and surfaces.
- The *licensed 3D model* refers to the *3D model* for which the *designer(s)* use(s) this license.
- A *3D digital file* means a digital representation of a *3D model*, in the form of a digital file that can be downloaded from the {{platform}} website in formats such as, but not limited to, STL, OBJ or 3DS.
- A *3D print* means a physical printed version of a *3D model* from a *3D digital file* downloaded from the {{platform}} website.
- An *adapted 3D model* means a *3D model* whose related *3D digital files* have been translated, retouched, arranged, transformed or modified from the *3D digital files* of the *licensed 3D model* downloaded from the website under this license in such a way that the permission of its *designer(s)* is required in accordance with the copyright provisions.
- The *designer(s)* means the copyright holder and author of the *licensed 3D model*,
- The *rights granted by the license* means the rights granted to you under the terms and conditions of use set forth in this license, limited to the copyright applicable to your use of the *licensed 3D model* and which the *designer(s)* has the right to grant.
- The term “*share*” means to make available to the public by any means or process that requires authorization under the *rights granted by the license*, such as reproduction, public performance, distribution, broadcast, communication or importation, including in such a way that it may be accessed by anyone from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

- reproduce and *share* *3D prints* of the *licensed 3D model*, in whole or in part for any purpose, including commercial use, in unlimited quantities;
- produce, reproduce and share *3D prints* of *adapted 3D models* from the *licensed 3D model*, for any use, including commercial use, in unlimited quantities;
- make available to the public through communication media such as social networks or websites the images of your *3D prints* of the *licensed 3D model* and those of its *adapted 3D models*.

#### Article 3 - Terms of use of this license

If you *share* *3D prints* of the *licensed 3D model*, including in modified form, you must:

- identify the *designer(s)* of the *licensed 3D model*, including in the form of a pseudonym if this information is indicated;
- indicate the existence of copyright;
- provide a notice referring to this license;
- provide a URI or hyperlink to the *licensed 3D model*;
- indicate whether you have modified the *licensed 3D model* and keep track of previous modifications.

If you share *3D prints* of your *adapted 3D models*, the license you apply to those *3D prints* must be without prejudice to compliance with this license by users of the *3D prints* of your *adapted 3D models*.

**This license does not include permissions** :

- for the sale, gift, exchange, distribution, or sharing of the *3D digital files* of the *licensed 3D model*;
- for the sale, gift, exchange, distribution, or sharing of the *3D digital files* of the *adapted 3D models*.

#### Article 4 - Limitations of Warranty and Disclaimers

Unless otherwise specified, this license does not make any warranty of any kind, including, but not limited to, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to it.

#### Article 5 - Duration and termination

This license applies for as long as it is in effect on the *licensed 3D model* on the {{platform}} website.
